> You can either use CLion IDE to compile and run the program, or you could use the makefile.			||||
> The makefile commands are as follows:										||||
	use 'make' to build											||||
	use 'make run' to run program										||||
	use 'make clean' to clean build outputs									||||
	use 'make tar' to create a .tar file with the cpp program, the makefile and text files			||||
	use 'make cleantar' to remove the .tar file								<==7
	use 'make cleanall' to clean all outputs: .tar file .o file and build file				||||
	use 'make runs' check files and build files and then run program					||||
	use 'make runc' rebuild files and then run program							||||

> Pick the rocket, from Falcon0, Falcon Heavy or Starlink. Alternatively, you can load a saved rocket		||||
  or simply exit.												||||
> Pick the payload, from Crew Dragon, Cargo Dragon or Starlink.							||||
> Depending on what you pick, you must then provide extra details such as the weight or crew size.		<==7
> After this, your rocket will be created. You can now move onto launch, or save the rocket to load		||||
  later.													||||
														||||
														||||
-==--<|| How to launch a rocket ||>--==--									||||
														||||
> After creating your rocket, you can now pick from a series of options.					<==7
> You can test it, create a simulation launch, or actual launch it, or save it to load later.			||||
> It is advisable to test the engines first and you will recieve a prompt for this. This will fire all		||||
  the engines for a brief moment to make sure that they all work.						||||
> There is a small chance per engine that it will fail to ignite, and an even smaller chance that it		||||
  will explode and take the rocket with it.									||||
> If an engine fails, it will automatically be repaired. If a rocket explodes, you will exit the launch		||||
  phase and have to create a new rocket.									<==7
														||||
-<|| Launch Sim ||>-												||||
														||||
> This mode will save the rocket and run a simulation of its launch, and restore the rocket			||||
  afterwards as if it was never launched at all.								||||
														||||
-<|| Test Mode ||>-												<==7
														||||
> This is similar to launch sim, except just after launch, you can completely recreate the rocket		||||
  midflight for testing purposes.										||||
														||||
-<|| Launch Actual ||>-												||||
														||||
> This will actually launch the rocket.										<==7
> It is advisable to test the rocket first, but this does not guarantee that it will not fail.			||||
> There is a small chance that one or more engines will fail, and a smaller chance that one or more		||||
  engines will explode and take the rocket with it.								||||
														||||
														||||
-==--<|| What to expect after launching ||>--==--								||||
														<==7
> The rocket will now launch to space.										||||
> There is a small chance for the rocket to fail.								||||
> The Falcon9 boosters will attempt to return to earth to be reused later. There is a small chance it		||||
  will miss and explode.											||||
> If everything goes according to plan, the Dragons will dock with the International Space Station,		||||
  and the Starlinks will be ejected into space.									||||
